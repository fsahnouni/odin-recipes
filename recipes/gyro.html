    <h1>Traditional Gyro Meat</h1>
    <img src="traditional gyro meat.jpg" alt="Traditional Gyro Meat">

    <p>This delicious gyro meat is the closest I've come to emulating my favorite Mediterranean restaurant's recipe. The Greek/Lebanese-style meatloaf is sliced and served with pita bread, tzatziki, and tomatoes. The preparation time seems long, but most of it is resting time, so you can be doing other things! </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds ground lamb</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 cup bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place the onion in a food processor, and process until finely chopped. Add the lamb and beef, then process for a few minutes until smooth. Stop the processor, and add the salt, pepper, oregano, parsley, and cumin. Process for 2 to 3 minutes, pausing to scrape the sides of the bowl, if necessary. Add the bread crumbs and garlic, and process for another minute.</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture in half, and shape into 2 loaves. Place on a broiler pan, and bake for 60 to 75 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Turn once halfway through cooking.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, and let stand for 10 minutes. Slice thinly, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
