    <p>
        Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari, or sumeshi.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups sushi rice</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 pound sushi-grade raw fish (tuna, salmon, or yellowtail), sliced into thin pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 cucumber, julienned</li>
        <li>1/2 avocado, sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup wasabi</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pickled ginger</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice in a strainer or colander until the water runs clear. Combine with water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for 20 minutes. Rice should be tender and water should be absorbed. Cool until cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Cook over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Cool, then stir into the cooked rice. When you pour this in, your rice is seasoned. It will give your sushi that authentic Japanese flavor. </li>
        <li>On a sushi mat, place a sheet of nori with the shiny side down. Wet your hands and grab a handful of rice to cover the nori. Press the rice down. Flip the sheet of nori over so the rice side is down. Place 1/4 of the cucumber, ginger, avocado, and fish in the center of the sheet. Roll the mat over, grabbing the far end and rolling it towards you. Press the roll into a compact rectangular shape using the mat. Cut into 4 to 6 equal pieces.</li>
    </ol>
